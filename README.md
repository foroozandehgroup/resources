# Useful resources

## Books

Most of these can be found at the Radcliffe Science Library (indeed, there may already be one copy loaned out to somebody in the group).
Electronic versions are usually available too
Alternatively, copies of these might exist in Ali's or Tim's offices, although these are probably harder to get to in 2020.

## Software

**Programming and other technology**

 - The latest versions of **MATLAB** and **Mathematica** can be downloaded and installed via [Oxford's IT Services](https://register.it.ox.ac.uk/self/index) (click on *"Register for and download site-licensed software"*).
 - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a popular way of installing **Python**, especially in the sciences, but (JY) I prefer [installing the "official" CPython implementation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) since you don't end up being so tied to a particular ecosystem. On Unix systems you can use your system's package manager to install it (on macOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)).
 - [Chacon, Straub: *Pro Git*](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a thorough but very readable introduction to version control with **Git**. If you have a GitHub account, let somebody know so that you can be added to [the group's GitHub organisation](https://github.com/foroozandehgroup).
 
**NMR processing software**

 - [TopSpin](https://www.bruker.com/service/support-upgrades/software-downloads/nmr/free-topspin-processing/nmr-topspin-license-for-academia.html): free to download with an academic email

**Open-source software for QM simulations**

 - [Spinach](http://spindynamics.org/Spinach.php/) (MATLAB)
 - [EasySpin](https://easyspin.org/) (MATLAB)
 - [SpinDynamica](http://www.spindynamica.soton.ac.uk/) (Mathematica)
